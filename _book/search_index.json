Therefore, you should expect constant changes in the security landscape, as new bugs and security risks are discovered, and new best practices are developed. Following the security practices in this document is therefore only the beginning of the security work you will need to do as a smart contract developer.\nSmart contract programming requires a different engineering mindset than you may be used to. The cost of failure can be high, and change can be difficult, making it in some ways more similar to hardware programming or financial services programming than web or mobile development. It is therefore not enough to defend against known vulnerabilities.

The general recommendation for any smart contract system is to identify the proper balance for these fundamental tradeoffs.\nAn ideal smart contract system from a software engineering bias is modular, reuses code instead of duplicating it, and supports upgradeable components.  An ideal smart contract system from a secure architecture bias may share this mindset, especially in the case of more complex smart contract systems.\nHowever, there are important exceptions where security and software engineering best practices may not be aligned.  In each case, the proper balance is obtained by identifying the optimal mix of properties along contract system dimensions such as:\n\nRigid versus Upgradeable \nMonolithic versus Modular\nDuplication versus Reuse\n\nRigid versus Upgradeable\nWhile multiple resources, including this one, emphasize malleability characteristics such as Killable, Upgradeable or Modifiable patterns there is a fundamental tradeoff between malleability and security.  \nMalleability patterns by definition add complexity and potential attack surfaces.  Simplicity is particularly effective over complexity in cases where the smart contract system performs a very limited set of functionality for a pre-defined limited period of time, for example a governance-free finite-time-frame token-sale contract system.\nMonolithic versus Modular\nA monolithic self-contained contract keeps all knowledge locally identifiable and readable.  While there are few smart contract systems held in high regard that exist as monoliths, there is an argument to be made for extreme locality of data and flow - for example, in the case of optimizing code review efficiency.\nAs with the other tradeoffs considered here, security best practices trend away from software engineering best practices in simple short-lived contracts and trend towared software engineering best practices in the case of more complex perpetual contract systems.\nDuplication versus Reuse\nA smart contract system from a software engineering perspective wishes to maximize reuse where reasonable.  There are many ways to reuse contract code in Solidity.  Using proven previously-deployed contracts which you own is generally the safest manner to achieve code reuse.\nDuplication is frequently relied upon in cases where self-owned previously-deployed contracts are not available.  Efforts such as Live Libs and Zeppelin Solidity seek to provide patterns such that secure code can be re-used without duplication.  Any contract security analyses must include any re-used code that has not previously established a level of trust commensurate with the funds at risk in the target smart contract system.\n"},"tips/":{"url":"tips/","title":"Solidity Security Tips","keywords":"","body":"\nRecommendations for Smart Contract Security in Solidity\n"},"tips/external_call.html":{"url":"tips/external_call.html","title":"External Call","keywords":"","body":"External Calls\nAvoid external calls when possible\n\nCalls to untrusted contracts can introduce several unexpected risks or errors. External calls may execute malicious code in that contract or any other contract that it depends upon. As such, every external call should be treated as a potential security risk, and removed if possible. When it is not possible to remove external calls, use the recommendations in the rest of this section to minimize the danger.\n\nBe aware of the tradeoffs between send(), transfer(), and call.value()()\nWhen sending Ether be aware of the relative tradeoffs between the use of\nsomeAddress.send(), someAddress.transfer(), and someAddress.call.value()().\n\nx.transfer(y) is equivalent to if (!x.send(y)) throw; Send is the low level counterpart of transfer, and it's advisable to use      transfer when possible.\nsomeAddress.send()and someAddress.transfer() are considered safe against reentrancy.\n  While these methods still trigger code execution, the called contract is\n  only given a stipend of 2,300 gas which is currently only enough to log an\n  event.\nsomeAddress.call.value()() will send the provided ether and trigger code\n  execution.  The executed code is given all available gas for execution\n  making this type of value transfer unsafe against reentrancy.\n\nUsing send() or transfer() will prevent reentrancy but it does so at the cost of being\nincompatible with any contract whose fallback function requires more than 2,300\ngas.  \nOne pattern that attempts to balance this trade-off is to implement both\na push and pull mechanism, using send() or transfer()\nfor the push component and call.value()() for the pull component.\nIt is worth pointing out that exclusive use of send() or transfer() for value transfers\ndoes not itself make a contract safe against reentrancy, but only makes those\nspecific value transfers safe against reentrancy.\n\nHandle errors in external calls\nSolidity offers low-level call methods that work on raw addresses: address.call(), address.callcode(), address.delegatecall(), and address.send. These low-level methods never throw an exception, but will return false if the call encounters an exception. On the other hand, contract calls (e.g., ExternalContract.doSomething()) will automatically propagate a throw (for example, ExternalContract.doSomething() will also throw if doSomething() throws).\nIf you choose to use the low-level call methods, make sure to handle the possibility that the call will fail, by checking the return value.\n// bad\nsomeAddress.send(55);\nsomeAddress.call.value(55)(); // this is doubly dangerous, as it will forward all remaining gas and doesn't check for result\nsomeAddress.call.value(100)(bytes4(sha3(\"deposit()\"))); // if deposit throws an exception, the raw call() will only return false and transaction will NOT be reverted\n\n// good\nif(!someAddress.send(55)) {\n    // Some failure code\n}\n\nExternalContract(someAddress).deposit.value(100);\n\nDon't make control flow assumptions after external calls\nWhether using raw calls or contract calls, assume that malicious code will execute if ExternalContract is untrusted. Even if ExternalContract is not malicious, malicious code can be executed by any contracts it calls. One particular danger is malicious code may hijack the control flow, leading to race conditions. (See Race Conditions for a fuller discussion of this problem).\n\nFavor pull over push for external calls\nExternal calls can fail accidentally or deliberately. To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is often better to isolate each external call into its own transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments, where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically. (This also reduces the chance of problems with the gas limit.)  Avoid combining multiple send() calls in a single transaction.\n// bad\ncontract auction {\n    address highestBidder;\n    uint highestBid;\n\n    function bid() payable {\n        if (msg.value  uint) refunds;\n\n    function bid() payable external {\n        if (msg.value "},"tips/assert.html":{"url":"tips/assert.html","title":"Assert","keywords":"","body":"\nEnforce invariants with assert()\nAn assert guard triggers when an assertion fails - such as an invariant property changing. For example, the token to ether issuance ratio, in a token issuance contract, may be fixed. You can verify that this is the case at all times with an assert(). Assert guards should often be combined with other techniques, such as pausing the contract and allowing upgrades. (Otherwise you may end up stuck, with an assertion that is always failing.)\nExample:\ncontract Token {\n    mapping(address => uint) public balanceOf;\n    uint public totalSupply;\n\n    function deposit() public payable {\n        balanceOf[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n        totalSupply += msg.value;\n        assert(this.balance >= totalSupply);\n    }\n}\nNote that the assertion is not a strict equality of the balance because the contract can be forcibly sent ether without going through the deposit() function!\nUse assert() and require() properly\nIn Solidity 0.4.10 assert() and require() were introduced. require(condition) is meant to be used for input validation, which should be done on any user input, and throws if condition is false. assert(condition) also throws if condition is false but should be used only for invariants: internal errors or to check if your contract has reached an invalid state.

Games (eg. on-chain rock-paper-scissors) and auction mechanisms (eg. sealed-bid second-price auctions) are two major categories of examples. If you are building an application where privacy is an issue, take care to avoid requiring users to publish information too early.\nExamples:\n\nIn rock paper scissors, require both players to submit a hash of their intended move first, then require both players to submit their move; if the submitted move does not match the hash throw it out.\nIn an auction, require players to submit a hash of their bid value in an initial phase (along with a deposit greater than their bid value), and then submit their action bid value in the second phase.\nWhen developing an application that depends on a random number generator, the order should always be (1) players submit moves, (2) random number generated, (3) players paid out. The method by which random numbers are generated is itself an area of active research; current best-in-class solutions include Bitcoin block headers (verified through http://btcrelay.org), hash-commit-reveal schemes (ie. one party generates a number, publishes its hash to \"commit\" to the value, and then reveals the value later) and RANDAO.\nIf you are implementing a frequent batch auction, a hash-commit scheme is also desirable.\n\nBe aware of the tradeoffs between abstract contracts and interfaces\nBoth interfaces and abstract contracts provide one with a customizable and re-usable approach for smart contracts. Interfaces, which were introduced in Solidity 0.4.11, are similar to abstract contracts but cannot have any functions implemented. Interfaces also have limitations such as not being able to access storage or inherit from other interfaces which generally makes abstract contracts more practical. Although, Interfaces are certainly useful for designing contracts prior to implementation. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that if a contract inherits from an abstract contract it must implement all non-implemented functions via overriding or it will be abstract as well. \nIn 2-party or N-party contracts, beware of the possibility that some participants may \"drop offline\" and not return\nDo not make refund or claim processes dependent on a specific party performing a particular action with no other way of getting the funds out. For example, in a rock-paper-scissors game, one common mistake is to not make a payout until both players submit their moves; however, a malicious player can \"grief\" the other by simply never submitting their move - in fact, if a player sees the other player's revealed move and determines that they lost, they have no reason to submit their own move at all. This issue may also arise in the context of state channel settlement. When such situations are an issue, (1) provide a way of circumventing non-participating participants, perhaps through a time limit, and (2) consider adding an additional economic incentive for participants to submit information in all of the situations in which they are supposed to do so.\n\nKeep fallback functions simple\nFallback functions are called when a contract is sent a message with no arguments (or when no function matches), and only has access to 2,300 gas when called from a .send() or .transfer(). If you wish to be able to receive Ether from a .send() or .transfer(), the most you can do in a fallback function is log an event.

This class of bug can take many forms, and both of the major bugs that led to the DAO's collapse were bugs of this sort.\n\nReentrancy\nThe first version of this bug to be noticed involved functions that could be called repeatedly, before the first invocation of the function was finished. This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in destructive ways.\n// INSECURE\nmapping (address => uint) private userBalances;\n\nfunction withdrawBalance() public {\n    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];\n    if (!(msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)())) { throw; } // At this point, the caller's code is executed, and can call withdrawBalance again\n    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;\n}\nSince the user's balance is not set to 0 until the very end of the function, the second (and later) invocations will still succeed, and will withdraw the balance over and over again. A very similar bug was one of the vulnerabilities in the DAO attack.\nIn the example given, the best way to avoid the problem is to use send() instead of call.value()(). This will prevent any external code from being executed.\nHowever, if you can't remove the external call, the next simplest way to prevent this attack is to make sure you don't call an external function until you've done all the internal work you need to do:\nmapping (address => uint) private userBalances;\n\nfunction withdrawBalance() public {\n    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];\n    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;\n    if (!(msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)())) { throw; } // The user's balance is already 0, so future invocations won't withdraw anything\n}\nNote that if you had another function which called withdrawBalance(), it would be potentially subject to the same attack, so you must treat any function which calls an untrusted contract as itself untrusted. See below for further discussion of potential solutions.\nCross-function Race Conditions\nAn attacker may also be able to do a similar attack using two different functions that share the same state.\n// INSECURE\nmapping (address => uint) private userBalances;\n\nfunction transfer(address to, uint amount) {\n    if (userBalances[msg.sender] >= amount) {\n       userBalances[to] += amount;\n       userBalances[msg.sender] -= amount;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction withdrawBalance() public {\n    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];\n    if (!(msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)())) { throw; } // At this point, the caller's code is executed, and can call transfer()\n    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;\n}\nIn this case, the attacker calls transfer() when their code is executed on the external call in withdrawBalance. Since their balance has not yet been set to 0, they are able to transfer the tokens even though they already received the withdrawal. This vulnerability was also used in the DAO attack.\nThe same solutions will work, with the same caveats. Also note that in this example, both functions were part of the same contract. However, the same bug can occur across multiple contracts, if those contracts share state.\nPitfalls in Race Condition Solutions\nSince race conditions can occur across multiple functions, and even multiple contracts, any solution aimed at preventing reentry will not be sufficient.\nInstead, we have recommended finishing all internal work first, and only then calling the external function. This rule, if followed carefully, will allow you to avoid race conditions. However, you need to not only avoid calling external functions too soon, but also avoid calling functions which call external functions. For example, the following is insecure:\n// INSECURE\nmapping (address => uint) private userBalances;\nmapping (address => bool) private claimedBonus;\nmapping (address => uint) private rewardsForA;\n\nfunction withdraw(address recipient) public {\n    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[recipient];\n    rewardsForA[recipient] = 0;\n    if (!(recipient.call.value(amountToWithdraw)())) { throw; }\n}\n\nfunction getFirstWithdrawalBonus(address recipient) public {\n    if (claimedBonus[recipient]) { throw; } // Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once\n\n    rewardsForA[recipient] += 100;\n    withdraw(recipient); // At this point, the caller will be able to execute getFirstWithdrawalBonus again.\n    claimedBonus[recipient] = true;\n}\nEven though getFirstWithdrawalBonus() doesn't directly call an external contract, the call in withdraw() is enough to make it vulnerable to a race condition. you therefore need to treat withdraw() as if it were also untrusted.\nmapping (address => uint) private userBalances;\nmapping (address => bool) private claimedBonus;\nmapping (address => uint) private rewardsForA;\n\nfunction untrustedWithdraw(address recipient) public {\n    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[recipient];\n    rewardsForA[recipient] = 0;\n    if (!(recipient.call.value(amountToWithdraw)())) { throw; }\n}\n\nfunction untrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus(address recipient) public {\n    if (claimedBonus[recipient]) { throw; } // Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once\n\n    claimedBonus[recipient] = true;\n    rewardsForA[recipient] += 100;\n    untrustedWithdraw(recipient); // claimedBonus has been set to true, so reentry is impossible\n}\nIn addition to the fix making reentry impossible, untrusted functions have been marked. This same pattern repeats at every level: since untrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus() calls untrustedWithdraw(), which calls an external contract, you must also treat untrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus() as insecure.\nAnother solution often suggested is a mutex. This allows you to \"lock\" some state so it can only be changed by the owner of the lock. A simple example might look like this:\n// Note: This is a rudimentary example, and mutexes are particularly useful where there is substantial logic and/or shared state\nmapping (address => uint) private balances;\nbool private lockBalances;\n\nfunction deposit() payable public returns (bool) {\n    if (!lockBalances) {\n        lockBalances = true;\n        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n        lockBalances = false;\n        return true;\n    }\n    throw;\n}\n\nfunction withdraw(uint amount) payable public returns (bool) {\n    if (!lockBalances && amount > 0 && balances[msg.sender] >= amount) {\n        lockBalances = true;\n\n        if (msg.sender.call(amount)()) { // Normally insecure, but the mutex saves it\n          balances[msg.sender] -= amount;\n        }\n\n        lockBalances = false;\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    throw;\n}\nIf the user tries to call withdraw() again before the first call finishes, the lock will prevent it from having any effect. This can be an effective pattern, but it gets tricky when you have multiple contracts that need to cooperate. The following is insecure:\n// INSECURE\ncontract StateHolder {\n    uint private n;\n    address private lockHolder;\n\n    function getLock() {\n        if (lockHolder != 0) { throw; }\n        lockHolder = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function releaseLock() {\n        lockHolder = 0;\n    }\n\n    function set(uint newState) {\n        if (msg.sender != lockHolder) { throw; }\n        n = newState;\n    }\n}\nAn attacker can call getLock(), and then never call releaseLock(). If they do this, then the contract will be locked forever, and no further changes will be able to be made. If you use mutexes to protect against race conditions, you will need to carefully ensure that there are no ways for a lock to be claimed and never released. (There are other potential dangers when programming with mutexes, such as deadlocks and livelocks. You should consult the large amount of literature already written on mutexes, if you decide to go this route.)\n\n\nSome may object to the use of the term race condition, since Ethereum does not currently have true parallelism. However, there is still the fundamental feature of logically distinct processes contending for resources, and the same sorts of pitfalls and potential solutions apply.\n\n\nTransaction-Ordering Dependence (TOD) / Front Running\nAbove were examples of race conditions involving the attacker executing malicious code within a single transaction. The following are a different type of race condition inherent to Blockchains: the fact that the order of transactions themselves (within a block) is easily subject to manipulation. \nSince a transaction is in the mempool for a short while, one can know what actions will occur, before it is included in a block. This can be troublesome for things like decentralized markets, where a transaction to buy some tokens can be seen, and a market order implemented before the other transaction gets included. Protecting against this is difficult, as it would come down to the specific contract itself. For example, in markets, it would be better to implement batch auctions (this also protects against high frequency trading concerns). Another way to use a pre-commit scheme (“I’m going to submit the details later”).\n\nTimestamp Dependence\nBe aware that the timestamp of the block can be manipulated by the miner, and all direct and indirect uses of the timestamp should be considered. Block numbers and average block time can be used to estimate time, but this is not future proof as block times may change (such as the changes expected during Casper).\nuint someVariable = now + 1;\n\nif (now % 2 == 0) { // the now can be manipulated by the miner\n\n}\n\nif ((someVariable - 100) % 2 == 0) { // someVariable can be manipulated by the miner\n\n}\n"},"attacks/gas_related_attacks.html":{"url":"attacks/gas_related_attacks.html","title":"Gas Related Attacks","keywords":"","body":"\nDoS with (Unexpected) Throw\nConsider a simple auction contract:\n// INSECURE\ncontract Auction {\n    address currentLeader;\n    uint highestBid;\n\n    function bid() payable {\n        if (msg.value When it tries to refund the old leader, it throws if the refund fails. This means that a malicious bidder can become the leader, while making sure that any refunds to their address will always fail. In this way, they can prevent anyone else from calling the bid() function, and stay the leader forever. A recommendation is to set up a pull payment system instead, as described earlier.\nAnother example is when a contract may iterate through an array to pay users (e.g., supporters in a crowdfunding contract). It's common to want to make sure that each payment succeeds. If not, one should throw. The issue is that if one call fails, you are reverting the whole payout system, meaning the loop will never complete. No one gets paid, because one address is forcing an error.\naddress[] private refundAddresses;\nmapping (address => uint) public refunds;\n\n// bad\nfunction refundAll() public {\n    for(uint x; x Again, the recommended solution is to favor pull over push payments.\n\nDoS with Block Gas Limit\nYou may have noticed another problem with the previous example: by paying out to everyone at once, you risk running into the block gas limit. Each Ethereum block can process a certain maximum amount of computation. If you try to go over that, your transaction will fail.\nThis can lead to problems even in the absence of an intentional attack. However, it's especially bad if an attacker can manipulate the amount of gas needed. In the case of the previous example, the attacker could add a bunch of addresses, each of which needs to get a very small refund. The gas cost of refunding each of the attacker's addresses could therefore end up being more than the gas limit, blocking the refund transaction from happening at all.\nThis is another reason to favor pull over push payments.\nIf you absolutely must loop over an array of unknown size, then you should plan for it to potentially take multiple blocks, and therefore require multiple transactions. You will need to keep track of how far you've gone, and be able to resume from that point, as in the following example:\nstruct Payee {\n    address addr;\n    uint256 value;\n}\nPayee payees[];\nuint256 nextPayeeIndex;\n\nfunction payOut() {\n    uint256 i = nextPayeeIndex;\n    while (i  200000) {\n      payees[i].addr.send(payees[i].value);\n      i++;\n    }\n    nextPayeeIndex = i;\n}\nYou will need to make sure that nothing bad will happen if other transactions are processed while waiting for the next iteration of the payOut() function. So only use this pattern if absolutely necessary.\n"},"attacks/overflow_underflow.html":{"url":"attacks/overflow_underflow.html","title":"Overflow/Underflow","keywords":"","body":"\nInteger Overflow and Underflow\nBe aware there are around 20 cases for overflow and underflow.\nConsider a simple token transfer:\nmapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n\n// INSECURE\nfunction transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) {\n    /* Check if sender has balance */\n    if (balanceOf[msg.sender] If a balance reaches the maximum uint value (2^256) it will circle back to zero.

Think about how the uint variable changes state, and who has authority to make such changes. If any user can call functions which update the uint value, it's more vulnerable to attack. If only an admin has access to change the variable's state, you might be safe. If a user can increment by only 1 at a time, you are probably also safe because there is no feasible way to reach this limit.\nThe same is true for underflow. If a uint is made to be less than zero, it will cause an underflow and get set to its maximum value. \nBe careful with the smaller data-types like uint8, uint16, uint24...etc: they can even more easily hit their maximum value.\nBe aware there are around 20 cases for overflow and underflow.\n"},"attacks/deprecated_attacks.html":{"url":"attacks/deprecated_attacks.html","title":"Deprecated Attacks","keywords":"","body":"\nCall Depth Attack\nAs of the EIP 150 hardfork, call depth attacks are no longer relevant* (all gas would be consumed well before reaching the 1024 call depth limit).\n"},"techniques/":{"url":"techniques/","title":"Software Engineering Techniques","keywords":"","body":"Software Engineering Techniques\nAs we discussed in the General Philosophy section, it is not enough to protect yourself against the known attacks. Since the cost of failure on a blockchain can be very high, you must also adapt the way you write software, to account for that risk.\nThe approach we advocate is to \"prepare for failure\". It is impossible to know in advance whether your code is secure. However, you can architect your contracts in a way that allows them to fail gracefully, and with minimal damage. This section presents a variety of techniques that will help you prepare for failure.\nNote: There's always a risk when you add a new component to your system. A badly designed fail-safe could itself become a vulnerability - as can the interaction between a number of well designed fail-safes. Be thoughtful about each technique you use in your contracts, and consider carefully how they work together to create a robust system.\n"},"techniques/upgrade_contract.html":{"url":"techniques/upgrade_contract.html","title":"Upgrading Broken Contracts","keywords":"","body":"Upgrading Broken Contracts\nCode will need to be changed if errors are discovered or if improvements need to be made. It is no good to discover a bug, but have no way to deal with it.\nDesigning an effective upgrade system for smart contracts is an area of active research, and we won't be able to cover all of the complications in this document. However, there are two basic approaches that are most commonly used. The simpler of the two is to have a registry contract that holds the address of the latest version of the contract. A more seamless approach for contract users is to have a contract that forwards calls and data onto the latest version of the contract.\nWhatever the technique, it's important to have modularization and good separation between components, so that code changes do not break functionality, orphan data, or require substantial costs to port. In particular, it is usually beneficial to separate complex logic from your data storage, so that you do not have to recreate all of the data in order to change the functionality.\nIt's also critical to have a secure way for parties to decide to upgrade the code. Depending on your contract, code changes may need to be approved by a single trusted party, a group of members, or a vote of the full set of stakeholders. If this process can take some time, you will want to consider if there are other ways to react more quickly in case of an attack, such as an emergency stop or circuit-breaker.\nExample 1: Use a registry contract to store latest version of a contract\nIn this example, the calls aren't forwarded, so users should fetch the current address each time before interacting with it.\ncontract SomeRegister {\n    address backendContract;\n    address[] previousBackends;\n    address owner;\n\n    function SomeRegister() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        if (msg.sender != owner) {\n            throw;\n        }\n        _;\n    }\n\n    function changeBackend(address newBackend) public\n    onlyOwner()\n    returns (bool)\n    {\n        if(newBackend != backendContract) {\n            previousBackends.push(backendContract);\n            backendContract = newBackend;\n            return true;\n        }\n\n        return false;\n    }\n}\nThere are two main disadvantages to this approach:\n\nUsers must always look up the current address, and anyone who fails to do so risks using an old version of the contract\nYou will need to think carefully about how to deal with the contract data, when you replace the contract\n\nThe alternate approach is to have a contract forward calls and data to the latest version of the contract:\nExample 2: Use a DELEGATECALL to forward data and calls\ncontract Relay {\n    address public currentVersion;\n    address public owner;\n\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        if (msg.sender != owner) {\n            throw;\n        }\n        _;\n    }\n\n    function Relay(address initAddr) {\n        currentVersion = initAddr;\n        owner = msg.sender; // this owner may be another contract with multisig, not a single contract owner\n    }\n\n    function changeContract(address newVersion) public\n    onlyOwner()\n    {\n        currentVersion = newVersion;\n    }\n\n    function() {\n        if(!currentVersion.delegatecall(msg.data)) throw;\n    }\n}\nThis approach avoids the previous problems, but has problems of its own. You must be extremely careful with how you store data in this contract. If your new contract has a different storage layout than the first, your data may end up corrupted. Additionally, this simple version of the pattern cannot return values from functions, only forward them, which limits its applicability. (More complex implementations attempt to solve this with in-line assembly code and a registry of return sizes.)\nRegardless of your approach, it is important to have some way to upgrade your contracts, or they will become unusable when the inevitable bugs are discovered in them.\n"},"techniques/pause_contract.html":{"url":"techniques/pause_contract.html","title":"Circuit Breakers","keywords":"","body":"Circuit Breakers (Pause contract functionality)\nCircuit breakers stop execution if certain conditions are met, and can be useful when new errors are discovered. For example, most actions may be suspended in a contract if a bug is discovered, and the only action now active is a withdrawal. You can either give certain trusted parties the ability to trigger the circuit breaker, or else have programmatic rules that automatically trigger the certain breaker when certain conditions are met.\nExample:\nbool private stopped = false;\naddress private owner;\n\nmodifier isAdmin() {\n    if(msg.sender != owner) {\n        throw;\n    }\n    _;\n}\n\nfunction toggleContractActive() isAdmin public\n{\n    // You can add an additional modifier that restricts stopping a contract to be based on another action, such as a vote of users\n    stopped = !stopped;\n}\n\nmodifier stopInEmergency { if (!stopped) _; }\nmodifier onlyInEmergency { if (stopped) _; }\n\nfunction deposit() stopInEmergency public\n{\n    // some code\n}\n\nfunction withdraw() onlyInEmergency public\n{\n    // some code\n}\n"},"techniques/speed_bump.html":{"url":"techniques/speed_bump.html","title":"Speed Bumps","keywords":"","body":"Speed Bumps (Delay contract actions)\nSpeed bumps slow down actions, so that if malicious actions occur, there is time to recover. For example, The DAO required 27 days between a successful request to split the DAO and the ability to do so. This ensured the funds were kept within the contract, increasing the likelihood of recovery. In the case of the DAO, there was no effective action that could be taken during the time given by the speed bump, but in combination with our other techniques, they can be quite effective.\nExample:\nstruct RequestedWithdrawal {\n    uint amount;\n    uint time;\n}\n\nmapping (address => uint) private balances;\nmapping (address => RequestedWithdrawal) private requestedWithdrawals;\nuint constant withdrawalWaitPeriod = 28 days; // 4 weeks\n\nfunction requestWithdrawal() public {\n    if (balances[msg.sender] > 0) {\n        uint amountToWithdraw = balances[msg.sender];\n        balances[msg.sender] = 0; // for simplicity, we withdraw everything;\n        // presumably, the deposit function prevents new deposits when withdrawals are in progress\n\n        requestedWithdrawals[msg.sender] = RequestedWithdrawal({\n            amount: amountToWithdraw,\n            time: now\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nfunction withdraw() public {\n    if(requestedWithdrawals[msg.sender].amount > 0 && now > requestedWithdrawals[msg.sender].time + withdrawalWaitPeriod) {\n        uint amountToWithdraw = requestedWithdrawals[msg.sender].amount;\n        requestedWithdrawals[msg.sender].amount = 0;\n\n        if(!msg.sender.send(amountToWithdraw)) {\n            throw;\n        }\n    }\n}\n"},"techniques/limit_rate.html":{"url":"techniques/limit_rate.html","title":"Rate Limiting","keywords":"","body":"ate Limiting\nRate limiting halts or requires approval for substantial changes.
